# Fan-Made-Star-Wars-game-
Since there are no good star wars games that are open-world or don't have what players want I have taken the step in creating that but I cannot do it myself. 

1. Procedural Planet Generation
Endless Variety: Planets should be procedurally generated to create infinite worlds for players to explore. This includes generating unique biomes (forests, deserts, icy planets) and landscapes (mountains, oceans, caves, etc.).

Atmospheric Variations: Planets should feature varying weather patterns, including storms, rains, or clear skies. The presence of alien flora and fauna would enhance the feeling of discovery.

Environmental Challenges: Each planet could have unique features or dangers. Some might have hostile alien creatures, while others may feature ancient ruins to uncover or hazardous terrain.

Goal: Keep the game world vast, random, and constantly evolving, giving players the feeling of exploring an infinite galaxy.

2. Space Exploration
Navigating the Stars: Space should feel vast and mysterious. Players need a means to travel between planets and explore distant star systems. Whether that’s through hyperspace travel or a warp drive, the transition should feel seamless and awe-inspiring.

Interactive Space Systems: Players can encounter various objects in space: asteroid fields, space stations, space anomalies (black holes, wormholes), and alien ships.

Dynamic Space Combat: If players choose to engage in space combat, this system should feature dogfights, ship upgrades, and AI-controlled enemies. Factions or hostile groups may also pose a threat.

Goal: Create a vast, immersive space experience where players can explore, battle, trade, and interact with the environment.

3. Customization and Ships
Ship Design: Players should be able to build, upgrade, and customize their ships, choosing from various classes like small fighters, medium-sized freighters, or large capital ships.

Ship Components: Customization would include upgrading the engine, weapons, shields, and other systems. Ship aesthetics should be varied and adaptable, with players able to change the appearance of their vessel.

Spacecraft vs Ground Vehicles: In addition to spaceships, ground-based vehicles (like rovers, hovercrafts, or tank-like vehicles) can be used to explore planets, battle enemies, or complete tasks.

Goal: Empower players with endless customization options, allowing them to adapt their ships to their playstyle.

4. Dynamic NPCs and Aliens
Alien Lifeforms: Planets should feature procedurally generated wildlife that varies by biome. This could range from small creatures to larger, more hostile species. Some planets may even feature intelligent alien civilizations with complex cultures.

Faction Interactions: Players can encounter various factions throughout the galaxy, from militaristic empires to independent rebels. These factions can offer quests, missions, and trade opportunities, but they may also engage in warfare.

NPC-Driven Events: NPCs will populate both space stations and planets, offering services like trading, ship repairs, or intelligence on other systems. Some may have personal quests, while others may challenge players with bounty hunting missions or explorations of unknown areas.

Goal: Create a living, breathing universe where NPCs, factions, and alien creatures offer variety and unpredictability.

5. Base Building and Exploration
Planetary Bases: Players should be able to create their own outposts or bases on planets, whether they are for resource extraction, research, or simply a place to rest.

Base Customization: Bases can be upgraded with defenses, resource collectors, storage units, and communication systems.

Dynamic Exploration: As players explore planets, they may encounter ancient ruins, secret bases, or alien structures, which could lead to new discoveries and rewards.

Goal: Make exploration rewarding and allow players to shape the environment they discover, adding layers of interaction and creativity.

6. Combat Systems
Space Combat: Space battles between factions, pirates, or even hostile creatures could range from small skirmishes to large-scale fleet battles. Combat mechanics should include shields, weapon energy management, and maneuvering tactics.

Ground Combat: On planets, players may engage in shootouts, melee combat, or strategic battles against alien creatures or hostile factions.

Customizable Weapons and Ships: Weapons for both space and ground combat should be upgradeable, from blasters and lasers to more advanced, experimental technology.

Goal: Offer players the freedom to engage in multiple combat styles across different environments, giving them the tools they need to survive.

7. Resource Management and Economy
Mining and Crafting: Players should be able to mine resources (minerals, metals, gases) from asteroids, planets, or space stations, which can then be used for crafting items, upgrading ships, or trading.

Dynamic Economy: The economy should be influenced by factors like resource scarcity, faction control, and player actions. Prices should fluctuate depending on the supply and demand of goods in different systems.

Trading: Players can trade resources with other players, NPCs, or factions, whether they’re delivering rare materials or exotic goods.

Goal: Create an engaging and player-driven economy where choices matter and resources are key to progress.

8. Questing and Storylines
Procedural Quests: To keep things fresh, the game should offer dynamic quests based on the player’s location and actions. This could include bounty hunting, exploration missions, or faction-related tasks.

Main Storyline: While the universe is procedurally generated, players can still embark on a narrative-driven journey. A galactic conflict or an ancient mystery might serve as the central plot, with the player’s actions influencing the outcome.

Side Missions: In addition to the main story, side missions and events can pop up, encouraging players to explore new planets or interact with NPCs.

Goal: Weave a rich, dynamic story experience within the open-world framework, offering both procedural and narrative-driven content.

9. Multiplayer 
Co-Op Gameplay: Allowing players to team up and explore the galaxy together could greatly enhance the game. Players can engage in joint space battles, explore planets, or even trade resources in a shared universe.

PvP Elements: Allow players to fight each other in space or on the ground. This could include ship-to-ship combat or ground-based skirmishes.

Goal: If multiplayer is implemented, ensure that it enhances the exploration and combat experience without breaking the immersion of the game.

10. User Interface (UI) and Accessibility
Map and Navigation: The game will need an intuitive star map or navigation system to allow players to easily explore star systems and planets.

Inventory and Ship Customization: A clean and simple UI to manage resources, ship upgrades, and quests is essential to keep players focused on the game without feeling overwhelmed.

Accessibility: Offering options like colorblind modes, adjustable difficulty, and subtitles will make the game more inclusive.

Goal: Make the game accessible, ensuring that players can easily navigate, customize, and enjoy the universe without unnecessary complexity.
